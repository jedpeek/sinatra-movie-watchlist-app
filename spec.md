Specs:

 [x] Use Sinatra to build the app

 [x] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database

 [x] Include more than one model class (list of model class names e.g. User, Post, Category) - uses a user, movie, and genre class

 [x] Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (x has_many y, e.g. User has_many Posts)- a user has_many movies

 [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (x belongs_to y, e.g. Post belongs_to User)- a movie belongs to a user.

 [x] Include user accounts - a user can create an account and login.

 [x] Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users- a movie can only be edited if the movies user matches the current user.

 [x] Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying-  a movie can be viewed, edited, deleted, and created.
